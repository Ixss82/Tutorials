# Contributing

## General rules
First of all, please do not attempt to define a new section(marked by a ##) in the readme. To keep this repo nice and well organized, it is important that we limit the number of headers.

## Adding to a table
The raw markdown table format we use the below:

``` 
| Left-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |          ---: |
| git status   | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff      |
``` 

When you want to make an entry, on the left column, please use the format:

```
 [Display name](insert link) ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitmentTime-difficulty-color.svg)
 ```
 
 Note that we use badges provided by Shields.io though please refrain yourself to the badge format used in the repo and not anything new!
 
 Finaly, on the left column, please add the prerequisites to follow whatever source you have added.
